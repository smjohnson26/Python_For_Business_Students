    "## Working with JSON\n",
    "First, how is JSON pronounced? Some pronounce as 'Jason', as in Jason Bourne. I prefer Jay-sahn, but feel free to pronounce it however you like.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "JSON are very similar in format to Python with a few exceptions. Boolean values are lowercase instead of title case, instead of None, JSON uses null. All keys are strings and values can be  strings, numbers, NULL, lists, or JSON. \n",
    "\n",
